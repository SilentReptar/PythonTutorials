#Python Strings - Tutorial 18
#-----------------------------

# Strings
#Strings in Python are surrounded by either signle quotation marks, or
#double quotation marks.
#'hello' is the same as "hello".
#You can display a string literal with the print() function:
#
#Example:
print("Hello")
print('Hello')


# Assign String to a Variable
#
#Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an
#equal sign and the string - Example:
x = "Hello"
print(x)


# Multiline Strings
#
#You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes - Example:
x2 = """Elephants have large feet, and long trunks.
pigs have short legs and a curley tail.
Sheep are wooley and say "baa"."""
print(x2)

#Or three single quotes - Example:
x3 = '''Elephants are grey and have large feet.
pigs are pink and say "oink".
Sheep are tasty and tender.'''
print(x3)
#Note: in the result, the line breaks are inserted at the same position as in the
#code.


# Strings are Arrays
#
#Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of
#bytes representing unicode characters.
#However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply
#a string with the length of 1.
#Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
#
#Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position
#zero) - Example:
x4 = "Hello, World!"
print(x4[1])



# Looping Through a String
#
#Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a
#for loop
#
#Loop through the letters in the word "banana" - Example:
for x5 in "banana":
    print(x5)
