#Global Variables - Tutorial 14

# Example 1
#(Creating a variable outside of a function, and use it inside the function):
x1 = "awesome"
print ("Example 1 - stringing singular global variable into a function:")
def myfunc1():
    print("Python is " + x)

myfunc1()

print ("\n")
#Note: If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.



# Example 2
#(Create a variable inside a function, with the same name as the global variable):
x2 = "awesome"
print ("Example 2 - stringing double assigned variables global vs locally:")
def myfunc2():
    x2 = "fantastic"
    print("Python is " + x2)

myfunc2()
print("Python is " + x2)

print ("\n")





# Global Keyword
# Example 3
#(If you use the gloabl keyword, the variable belongs to the global scope): 
def myfunc3():
    global x3
    x3 = "fantastic"

myfunc3()
print("Python is " + x3)

print ("\n")
#Note: Also, use the global keyword if you want to change a global variable inside a function.



# Example 4
#(To change the value of a global variable inside a function, refer to the variable by using the global keyword):
x4 = "awesome"

def myfunc4():
    global x4
    x4 = "fantastic"

myfunc4()
print("python is " + x4)

print ("\n")
