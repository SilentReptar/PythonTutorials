# Python Slicing String
#-------------------------------------


# Sclicing
#
#You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
#Specify the start index adn the end index, sperated by a colon, to return the part of the string.
#
#Example - Get the characters from positions 2 to positions 5 (not included):
b = "Hello, World!";
print(b[2:5]);
#
#Note: The first character has index 0.




# Slice From the Start
#
#By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:
#
#Example - Get the characters from the start to position 5 (not included):
b2 = "Hello, World!";
print(b2[:5]);




# Slice To the End
#
#By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:
#
#Example - Get the characters from position 2, and all the way to the end:
b3 = "Hello, World!";
print(b3[-5:-2]);




# Negative Indexing
#
#Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:
#
#Example - Get the characters:
# -> From: "o" in "World!" (position -5)
# -> To, but not included: "d" in "World!" (position -2):
b4 = "Hello, World!";
print(b4[-5:-2])
